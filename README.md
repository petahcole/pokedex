This is my first attempt at a side project.
We're working on API calls and DOM manipulation in class 
and I wanted a fun way to integrate those and build on an example
we did in class.

It's simple. Some basic HTML and CSS. 
Mostly I just want to practice simple API calls with jQ,
DOM manipulation with jQ,
and styling with CSS!
